See how long your emergency fund would last based on your actual spending patterns.

## How it works

Instead of guessing whether you have "3-6 months of expenses saved," this plugin calculates it from your real spending history. It looks at what you actually spend, not what you think you spend, and tells you exactly how many months of runway your emergency fund provides.

## What you'll see

- **Months of runway** - How long your fund would last at your current burn rate
- **Expense breakdown** - Which categories drive your monthly spending
- **Progress snapshots** - Track how your runway changes over time
- **Configurable calculation** - Mean, median, or trimmed mean for expense averaging

## Getting started

Link the plugin to your emergency fund (either through a Savings Goal or by selecting accounts directly). Choose which expense accounts to include in the calculation, and optionally exclude tags that shouldn't count (like one-time purchases or transfers). The plugin handles the rest.
